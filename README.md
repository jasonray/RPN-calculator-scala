The RPN [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation] calculator implementation is a good exercise for working through a languages capabilities and exploring OO strategies.

I have done four variations of the RPN calculator as exploratory into languages: 
-   [java](https://github.com/jasonray/RPN-calculator) 
-   [scala](https://github.com/jasonray/RPN-calculator-scala)
-   [javascript / node.js](https://github.com/jasonray/RPN-calculator-node)
-   [python](https://github.com/jasonray/RPN-calculator-python)
